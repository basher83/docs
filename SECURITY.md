# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Mission Security Statement

Security is paramount to our documentation infrastructure. We take the security of our documentation
repository and its users seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our systems safe.

## 🚨 Supported Versions

As a continuously updated documentation repository, we maintain security for:

| Version     | Supported    | Security Updates  |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| main        | ✅ Current   | Full support      |
| PR branches | ⚠️ Limited   | During review     |
| Forks       | ❌ Community | No direct support |

**Recommendation:** Always use the latest main branch for the most secure and up-to-date
documentation.

## 🔍 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### 🚨 Critical Security Issues

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull
requests.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these secure channels:

#### GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/basher83/docs/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form
4. Submit your report

#### Direct Contact

- **GitHub:** Create a private security advisory
- **Response Time:** Within 48 hours

### 📋 What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible:

**🎯 Vulnerability Details:**

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., exposed secrets, malicious scripts, XSS in markdown)
- Affected files, configurations, or workflows
- Attack vector and prerequisites
- Potential impact on users or systems

**🔍 Reproduction Steps:**

1. Detailed step-by-step reproduction
2. Proof of concept if applicable
3. Screenshots if helpful
4. Any special setup required

**💥 Impact Assessment:**

- What sensitive information could be exposed?
- What systems could be compromised?
- Could this affect users who clone/fork the repository?

### 🚀 Our Response Process

**Within 48 hours:**

- Acknowledge receipt of your report
- Begin initial assessment
- Assign a tracking ID for communication

**Within 1 week:**

- Complete vulnerability verification
- Assess severity and impact
- Develop remediation timeline

**Resolution:**

- Develop and test security fix
- Prepare security advisory if needed
- Release fix and notify affected users

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 🔐 Repository Security

- **Branch Protection:** Main branch requires reviews and status checks
- **Actions Security:** All GitHub Actions are pinned to specific SHAs
- **Secret Management:** Using Infisical for secure secret storage
- **Code Review:** All changes require review before merging

### 🔒 Secrets & Credentials

- **No Direct Secrets:** Never commit secrets directly to the repository
- **Template Files:** Use `.template` files for configuration examples
- **Gitignore:** Properly configured to exclude sensitive files
- **Secret Scanning:** Automated scanning with gitleaks and detect-secrets

### 🏗️ CI/CD Security

- **Pinned Actions:** All GitHub Actions use SHA pinning
- **Minimal Permissions:** Workflows use least-privilege permissions
- **Dependency Updates:** Automated updates via Renovate
- **Security Checks:** Pre-commit hooks for secret detection

### 👥 Development Security

- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Automated security checks before commits
- **Linting:** Shell scripts checked with shellcheck
- **Documentation:** Security best practices documented
- **MCP Configuration:** Secure handling of API keys

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Automated Security Checks

- **Every Commit:** Pre-commit hooks scan for secrets
- **Every PR:** GitHub Actions verify security policies
- **Continuous:** Dependabot and Renovate monitor dependencies

### Security Tools in Use

- **gitleaks:** Scans for exposed secrets
- **detect-secrets:** Additional secret detection
- **shellcheck:** Shell script vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security:** Native security features enabled

## 📊 Security Configuration Files

### Key Security Files

- `.gitignore` - Excludes sensitive files
- `.gitleaks.toml` - Gitleaks configuration
- `.secrets.baseline` - Detect-secrets baseline
- `mcp.json.template` - Template for secure configuration
- `.github/workflows/*` - Secured CI/CD pipelines

## 🎯 Responsible Disclosure

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure

### Your Responsibilities

When researching vulnerabilities, please:

- **Respect privacy** - Don't access private repositories or user data
- **Minimize impact** - Don't perform destructive actions
- **Report promptly** - Submit findings as soon as possible
- **Keep confidential** - Don't disclose until we've addressed the issue

### Out of Scope

The following are generally out of scope:

- Issues in third-party services (GitHub, Infisical, etc.)
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues already reported or known

## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Before Contributing

- Never commit real API keys or tokens
- Use template files for configuration examples
- Run pre-commit hooks before pushing
- Review your changes for sensitive data

### Working with Secrets

- Use Infisical for secret management
- Generate `.mcp.json` from template using the provided script
- Keep `.env` and similar files in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for sensitive values

### GitHub Actions

- Always pin Actions to specific SHAs
- Use minimal required permissions
- Don't echo secrets in logs
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values
