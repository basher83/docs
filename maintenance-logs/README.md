# üìù Maintenance Logs - Project Journals & Decision History

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/basher83/docs?path=maintenance-logs/README.md&display_timestamp=committer)

## Overview

Maintenance Logs chronicles the journey of technical decisions, learning experiences, and project
evolution. This chronological documentation captures the "why" behind architectural choices, lessons
learned from implementations, and the ongoing maintenance history of systems.

## üìö Available Logs

| Document                              | Description                                               | Type        |

| [Learning Paths](./learning-paths.md) | Documented learning journeys and skill development tracks | Educational |

## üéØ Purpose

Maintenance Logs serves as:

- **Decision Journal** - Record of architectural and technical decisions with context
- **Learning Archive** - Documented paths through new technologies and concepts
- **Troubleshooting History** - Solutions to past problems for future reference
- **Project Evolution** - Timeline of how systems have grown and changed

## üìñ Content Categories

### Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capturing:

- Context and problem statement
- Options considered
- Decision made and rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs

### Learning Journals

Progressive documentation of:

- Technology exploration paths
- Skill development milestones
- Resource collections
- Practical exercises and outcomes

### Maintenance History

Operational logs including:

- System upgrades and migrations
- Performance optimizations
- Security hardening steps
- Incident post-mortems

### Project Notes

Development chronicles:

- Feature implementation stories
- Refactoring rationales
- Integration challenges
- Success metrics

## üîç Organization Principles

### Chronological Structure

- Files organized by date or project phase
- Clear timestamps on all entries
- Version history preserved

### Categorization

- **[DECISION]** - Architectural choices
- **[LEARNING]** - Educational content
- **[INCIDENT]** - Problem resolutions
- **[UPGRADE]** - System updates
- **[EXPERIMENT]** - Trial implementations

## üìù Entry Format

Standard log entry structure:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: Entry Title

**Category**: [CATEGORY] **Impact**: High/Medium/Low **Status**: Planned/In
Progress/Completed/Archived

### Context

Background information and triggering events

### Action/Decision

What was done or decided

### Outcome

Results and lessons learned

### Follow-up

Next steps or related tasks
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Write Contemporaneously** - Document while memories are fresh
2. **Include Context** - Future you will thank present you
3. **Be Honest** - Document failures and lessons learned
4. **Link Liberally** - Connect related decisions and outcomes
5. **Review Periodically** - Update status of ongoing items
