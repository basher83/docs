# 📊 Project Management Guide

![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Last%20Updated-2025--06--09-success)

Comprehensive guide for using GitHub's project management features effectively with space-themed organization.

## Overview

This guide covers GitHub Issues, Projects, Milestones, and Labels for effective project management using space exploration metaphors.

## Space-Themed Project Organization

### Mission Phases (Milestones)

Structure projects using space mission phases:

**🎯 Mission Phase 1: Planning & Preparation**

- Requirements gathering
- Architecture design
- Resource allocation
- Team assembly

**🚀 Mission Phase 2: Launch & Development**

- Core development
- Feature implementation
- Initial testing
- Basic documentation

**🌟 Mission Phase 3: Operational Excellence**

- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation completion
- Community engagement

**🛰️ Mission Phase 4: Orbital Maintenance**

- Bug fixes
- Security updates
- Feature enhancements
- Long-term support

## Labels System

### Primary Label Categories

### Label Application Strategy

**Issue Creation:**

1. Apply mission status (`🚀 ready-for-launch`)
2. Set priority level
3. Add type classification
4. Estimate effort required
5. Assign to appropriate crew

**During Development:**

1. Update mission status (`🛰️ in-orbit`)
2. Adjust priority if needed
3. Add progress indicators
4. Tag blockers or dependencies

## GitHub Issues Management

Brief description of what was supposed to happen.

## 🚨 Current Behavior
What actually happened.

## 🛰️ Expected Behavior
What should have happened.

## 🔍 Investigation Steps
- [ ] Reviewed system logs
- [ ] Checked configuration
- [ ] Verified dependencies

## 📊 Mission Data
- Environment: [production/staging/development]
- Browser/OS: [if applicable]
- Version: [application version]

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution
Suggested approach to resolve the issue.
```

**✨ Feature Request Template:**

```markdown
# ✨ Mission Enhancement Request

## 🎯 Mission Objective

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
Detailed description of the feature.

## 🛰️ Mission Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

## 📊 Success Metrics
How will we measure success?

## 🗺️ Implementation Plan
High-level approach to implementation.
```

### Issue Lifecycle

**1. Triage Process:**

```bash
# New issue arrives
# Apply initial labels
# Assign to appropriate milestone
# Add to project board
# Request additional information if needed
```

**2. Planning Phase:**

```bash
# Technical review
# Effort estimation
# Resource allocation
# Dependencies identification
# Timeline planning
```

**3. Development Phase:**

```bash
# Update status to "in-orbit"
# Assign to developer
# Link related PRs
# Progress updates in comments
```

**4. Review & Completion:**

```bash
# Code review
# Testing verification
# Documentation updates
# Status update to "mission-complete"
```

## GitHub Projects

### Project Board Structure

**Mission Control Board Layout:**

**🎯 Mission Briefing (Backlog)**

- New issues awaiting triage
- Feature requests under consideration
- Planning items

**🚀 Pre-Launch (Ready)**

- Issues ready for development
- Requirements clarified
- Resources allocated

**🛰️ In Orbit (In Progress)**

- Active development
- Code review in progress
- Testing underway

**🔍 Mission Review (Review)**

- Pending code review
- Awaiting stakeholder approval
- Final testing

**🌟 Mission Complete (Done)**

### Automation Rules

**Auto-move cards:**

```yaml
# When PR is opened
if: pr.opened
then: move_to("🔍 Mission Review")

# When PR is merged
if: pr.merged
then: move_to("🌟 Mission Complete")

# When issue is labeled "🛰️ in-orbit"
if: issue.labeled("🛰️ in-orbit")
then: move_to("🛰️ In Orbit")
```

## Milestones Management

### Milestone Planning

**Quarter-based Milestones:**
