# GitHub Templates

## Instructions for Using Templates

All templates use tags that should be searched and replaced in each new repository.

### Tags to Replace

- [REPO]: Repository name (e.g., my-awesome-project)
- [PROJECT_NAME]: Human-friendly project name (e.g., My Awesome Project)
- [EMAIL_ADDRESS]: Contact email for the project (e.g., iamawesome@awesome.com)

### How to Use

1. Copy the desired template(s) into your new repository.
2. Search for each tag listed above and replace it with your projectâ€™s values.
3. Review for any additional project-specific customization.
4. Commit and push the changes.

### Example

Before:
> Welcome to [PROJECT_NAME]! Please see our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

After:
> Welcome to My Awesome Project! Please see our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

**Tip:** Check docs-main regularly for updated templates to keep your repositories consistent.
