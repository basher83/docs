## Why a Separate Repository Is Better for Assets

- Organization: Keeps your main profile repo clean and focused on your actual README and profile information
- Reusability: Makes it easy to reference the same assets across multiple repositories (profile, projects, documentation)
- Version Control: You can update assets without cluttering your profile repo's commit history
- Size Management: GitHub has soft limits on repository sizes - keeping media assets separate prevents your main profile from growing too large
- Permissions: You can give specific collaborators access to help with assets without giving them access to your profile
- CDN Benefits: GitHub serves raw files from repositories via its CDN, making this an effective hosting solution
