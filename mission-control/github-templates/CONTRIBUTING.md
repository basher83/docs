# 🚀 Contributing to the Mission

Welcome, fellow space explorer! We're thrilled that you want to contribute to our mission. This guide will help you navigate the contribution process and ensure your efforts align with our mission objectives.

## 🎯 Mission Values

Our space-themed project operates under these core principles:

- **🌟 Excellence in Execution** - Quality code and documentation
- **🤝 Collaborative Spirit** - Open communication and mutual respect  
- **🔒 Mission Security** - Safe and secure practices
- **📚 Knowledge Sharing** - Clear documentation and learning
- **🚀 Continuous Improvement** - Always evolving and growing

## 🛰️ Getting Started

### 1. Mission Briefing
Before contributing, familiarize yourself with:
- Project documentation and README
- Existing issues and discussions
- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Commit conventions](../../flight-manuals/gitops/commit-conventions.md)

### 2. Setting Up Your Mission Control
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git
cd PROJECT_NAME

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/basher83/PROJECT_NAME.git

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or appropriate package manager

# Run tests to ensure everything works
npm test
```

### 3. Choosing Your Mission
Look for issues labeled with:
- 🟢 `good-first-issue` - Perfect for new contributors
- 🤝 `help-wanted` - We need assistance with these
- 📚 `documentation` - Help improve our mission manuals
- 🐛 `bug` - Fix mission anomalies

## 🚀 Contribution Workflow

### Step 1: Mission Planning
1. **Find or create an issue** describing what you want to work on
2. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
3. **Get confirmation** from maintainers for larger changes

### Step 2: Development Phase
1. **Create a feature branch** from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/mission-name
   ```

2. **Follow our coding standards:**
   - Use consistent formatting (Prettier/ESLint configs)
   - Write clear, descriptive variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow existing architectural patterns

3. **Write tests** for new functionality:
   ```bash
   # Run tests frequently during development
   npm test
   
   # Check test coverage
   npm run coverage
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using our [commit conventions](../../flight-manuals/gitops/commit-conventions.md):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "🎯 feat(auth): add OAuth 2.0 integration
   
   Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with support for
   multiple providers. Includes token refresh and proper
   error handling.
   
   Closes: #123"
   ```

### Step 3: Mission Review
1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Run the full test suite:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:full
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Create a pull request** using our [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
4. **Respond to feedback** promptly and professionally

- 🚀 "Ready for launch!" - Approved
- 🔍 "Navigation check needed" - Changes requested
- 🛰️ "Orbital adjustment suggested" - Minor suggestions
- ⚠️ "Mission critical issue" - Blocking concerns

## 🛡️ Quality Standards

### Code Standards
- **Linting:** Code must pass all linting rules
- **Testing:** Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
- **Documentation:** All public APIs must be documented
- **Performance:** No degradation in performance metrics

### Git Standards
- **Commit Messages:** Follow our commit conventions
- **Branch Names:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `feat/user-auth`, `fix/login-bug`)
- **History:** Keep git history clean (squash small commits)
