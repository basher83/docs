      description: Describe your ideal solution in detail. How should this work?
      placeholder: |
        I propose adding an automated backup system that:
        1. Runs daily at a user-specified time
        2. Backs up to multiple cloud providers
        3. Sends notification when complete
        4. Allows for easy restoration of data

        The interface could include a simple toggle in settings and options for backup frequency.
