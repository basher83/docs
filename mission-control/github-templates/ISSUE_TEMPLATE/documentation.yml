        ## OAuth 2.0 Authentication
        1. Register your application
        2. Redirect users to authorization endpoint
        3. Handle the callback with authorization code
        4. Exchange code for access token
        
        Example code:
        ```javascript
        const response = await fetch('/oauth/token', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            grant_type: 'authorization_code',
            code: authCode,
            client_id: 'your-client-id'
          })
        });
