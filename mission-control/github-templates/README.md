# ðŸ‘¥ GitHub Templates: Community Interaction Standards

**Philosophy**: *"How do we welcome and guide our crew?"*

Community-facing templates that define how contributors interact with your repositories. These standardized documents establish clear communication protocols, contribution guidelines, and community standards across all projects.

```plaintext
github-templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md               # Contributor onboarding & guidelines
â”œâ”€â”€ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md           # Community behavior standards
â”œâ”€â”€ SECURITY.md                  # Security reporting procedures
â”œâ”€â”€ pull_request_template.md     # PR submission guidelines
â””â”€â”€ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
    â”œâ”€â”€ bug-report.yml           # Bug report standardization (YAML format)
    â”œâ”€â”€ feature-request.yml      # Feature proposal format (YAML format)
    â”œâ”€â”€ documentation.yml        # Documentation improvement requests
    â””â”€â”€ config.yml               # Issue template configuration
```
