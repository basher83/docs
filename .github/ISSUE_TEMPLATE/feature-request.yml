        I propose adding a comprehensive Kubernetes on Proxmox guide that includes:

        1. **Prerequisites and Planning**
           - Hardware requirements
           - Network architecture planning
           - Storage considerations

        2. **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**
           - Creating VMs for control plane and workers
           - Installing Kubernetes using kubeadm
           - Configuring CNI (Calico/Flannel)
           - Setting up LoadBalancer with MetalLB

        3. **Integration Points**
           - Using Proxmox CSI for persistent volumes
           - Backup strategies
           - Monitoring setup

        4. **Troubleshooting Section**

        **Use Case 1: Homelab Kubernetes**
        As a homelab enthusiast, I want to run Kubernetes on my Proxmox server
        so that I can learn container orchestration without cloud costs.

        **Use Case 2: Development Environment**
        As a developer, I need a local Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox
        for testing applications before cloud deployment.

        **Use Case 3: Small Business Infrastructure**
        As a small business IT admin, I want to deploy production workloads
        on Kubernetes using existing Proxmox infrastructure.
